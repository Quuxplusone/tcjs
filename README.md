# tcjs

The goal is to write web front-end completely in C++ instead of JavaScript.
The mean is to create type-safe JavaScript bindings for C++/Emscripten from TypeScript declaration files.

# Dependencies

* [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/) (Node.js and NPM are included)
* [think-cell public library](https://github.com/think-cell/range)
* Boost 1.68.0 or newer
